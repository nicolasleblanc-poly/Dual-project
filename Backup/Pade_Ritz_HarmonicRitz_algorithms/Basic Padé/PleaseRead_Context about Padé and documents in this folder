The original Padé approximant code was first worked on by another student and was handed over to me. The PadeApprox_OG_document is a document explaining the different parts of the code written by the other student. The original code not completely functionning code that was given to me can be found in the Search_algoV5.01.jl file. The code had some bugs and had trouble converging, so I modified it and the basic version of the algorithm can be found in the Nic_BasicPadeRootSolver.jl file. This file is simply a modification of the original one to make it run. A lot of different parts have been modified in the versions of the Padé code that are actually used. This file is just to show the most basic version of what is going on.
